  <!--Components of AC units-->
  <p>Components of an AC units</p>
  <p>The following table shows what are the most basic component you will commonly see in most AC units</p>
  <!--Indoor Components table-->
  <table>
    <caption>Common components of an AC Indoor</caption>
    <tr>
      <td>Component's Name</td>
      <td>Function</td>
    </tr>
    <!--Plenum-->
    <tr>
      <td>Plenum<br>Transition<br>Ductwork</td>
      <td>part of a building that can facilitate air circulation, by providing pathways for heated/conditioned or return airflow</td>
    </tr>
    <!--Evaporator Coil-->
    <tr>
      <td>Evaporator Coil</td>
      <td>Convert refrigerant from liquid to vapor, can be seen as an A, Z, or Slab Coil<>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <!--Filter Blower-->
    <tr>
      <td>Filter Blower</td>
      <td>Protect blower from any foreign material in the air</td>
    </tr>
    <!--Return Air Duct-->
    <tr>
      <td>Return Air Duct</td>
      <td>Where air returns to be heated or cooled, usually with an installed filter </td>
    </tr>
    <!--Expansion Valve-->
    <tr>
      <td>Expansion Valve</td>
      <td>Lower pressure from refrigerant, expanding air space</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <!--Outdoor Component-->
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>Compnent's Name</td>
      <td>Function</td>
    </tr>
    <!--Condenser Unit-->
    <tr>
      <td>Condenser Unit</td>
      <td>A shell containing all condenser parts inside it with fins near the coil</td>
    </tr>
     <!--Condenser fan-->
    <tr>
      <td>Condenser Fan</td>
      <td>Transfer heat from refrigerant to outside, prevent compressor from overheating</td>
    </tr>  
    <!--Condenser Coil-->
    <tr>
      <td>Condenser Coil</td>
      <td>Convert refrigerant to Vapor to Liquid</td>
    </tr>
    <!--Compressor-->
    <tr>
      <td>Compressor</td>
      <td>Compresses refrigerant to high temperature and is the heart of the hvac system, transporting refrigerant through coils</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>*Note* There is one more component that is in an hvac system, but it purpose is to provide heat through a heating element or what we call a furnance</p>
  <p>A furnance may comes in 2 different types: Gas heater or Air Handler(Electric)</p>
