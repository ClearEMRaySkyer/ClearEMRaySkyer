Medabot 9 Guide

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hello I am GX01 and this will be my second making of a guide of a game. I want to try something a little different from this time around and hopefully make this guide a little bit more interactive and simple for players to enjoy this game without much Japanese. As for my fluentcy in Japanese, it is not there yet so in this guide will be more of how to progress through rather than explaning the story.</p>
